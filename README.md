# Taco Track

## Udacity Frontend Developer Nano Degree Project 7

## Summary:
Taco Track is Taco Truck mapping app. Taco Track uses API data to map, locate, and display information on Taco Trucks in Oxnard, California. A marker identifies the location of each taco truck on the map. The user clicks on the designated map marker to receive additional information about the Taco Truck, including a photograph when available. It's worth taking note that none of the local taco trucks have websites but utilize Facebook as an alternative.

The user clicks on the hamburger menu icon to access a search input window and a pre-populated list of Taco Trucks. Users can track and enjoy some of the best Mexican food in the country.

## Purpose:
This is a Reactjs Neighborhood Map app built as the final project of the Udacity Frontend Developer Nano Degree.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started:
### `Clone or fork repository.`
(https://github.com/SoCalChristina/react-neighborhood-map)

### `npm install`

Adds the required dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### Service Worker
This app uses the default service worker provided in the starter code. The service worker only works in production build.

The service worker is opt-in only. To opt-in, open the serviceWorker.js file and change registration.unregister(); to registration.register();.

If you need to test your offline-first service worker locally, build the application (using npm run build) and run a simple http server from your build directory.
