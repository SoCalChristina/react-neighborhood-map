# Taco Track

## Udacity Frontend Developer Nano Degree Project 7

## Summary:
Taco Track is Taco Truck mapping app. Taco Track uses API data to map, locate, and display information on Taco Trucks in Oxnard, California. A marker identifies the location of each taco truck on the map. The user clicks on the designated map marker to receive additional information about the Taco Truck, including a photograph when available. It's worth taking note that none of the local taco trucks have websites but utilize Facebook as an alternative.

The user clicks on the hamburger menu icon to access a search input window and a pre-populated list of Taco Trucks. Users can track and enjoy some of the best Mexican food in the country.
